# Music Player

This is the Music Player project I developed, designed to provide a seamless music listening experience with features to manage and control song playback.

The Music Player allows users to play, pause, stop, and seek through songs, and includes essential functionality such as handling playlists and track selection. The application is built with a focus on modularity, supporting features like continuous playback updates and a smooth user interface for controlling music.

The player also integrates a periodic worker to monitor playback status and ensure real-time updates on the song's current position. It supports various user actions, from selecting a song to playing or pausing music, with error handling and proper cleanup when the playback stops. This project demonstrates a practical implementation of Android's `MediaPlayer` and leverages `ViewModel`s for managing state across multiple screens, creating a responsive music application.
